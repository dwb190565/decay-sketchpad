🎨 Decay Sketchpad 🧠 

The Decay Sketchpad is an interactive web-based drawing application that transforms your mouse or touch gestures into dynamic particle trails, accompanied by an evolving soundscape and a visually responsive background. It’s designed to be a meditative and creative tool, allowing users to explore the interplay between visual art and generative audio.

As you draw on the canvas:

✨ Particles are emitted, which decay, mutate in color, and shrink over time.

🎶 Ambient textures, rhythmic clicks, and melodic fragments are generated using Tone.js, reacting to the speed and direction of your strokes.

🌈 The background color subtly shifts and evolves, reflecting the intensity of your drawing activity — creating an “emotional” feedback loop.

🌟 Features
🖌️ Particle Drawing: Create unique visual strokes with particles that decay and evolve.

🎼 Generative Audio: Experience an ambient, rhythmic, and melodic soundscape that responds to your drawing.

🌌 Responsive Background: Canvas background color dynamically changes based on your drawing gestures.

🤲 Interactive and Intuitive: Simple mouse and touch controls for immediate artistic expression.

🕊️ Ephemeral Art: Enjoy the beauty of transient art as particles fade and mutate.

🧰 Technologies Used
🧱 HTML5: For the basic structure of the web page.

🎨 CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For styling and responsive layout.

🧪 Three.js: JavaScript 3D library used for rendering and animating the particles.

🎧 Tone.js: Web Audio framework for creating and managing the generative sound elements.

🚀 How to Use
🔓 Open the Application: Simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

✍️ Start Drawing: Click and drag your mouse, or touch and drag your finger on the canvas area.

👂 Listen and Observe: Notice how particles appear, move, and fade, and how the sounds and background colors respond to your drawing speed and movements.

🧪 Experiment: Try different drawing speeds, patterns, and gestures to discover various visual and auditory effects.

🔮 Future Enhancements
🛠️ Customization Options: Add UI controls for particle properties (size, lifespan, color), sound parameters (volume, reverb, synth types), and background responsiveness.

💾 Saving/Sharing: Implement functionality to save drawings as images or share unique soundscapes.

🧬 More Complex Interactions: Explore advanced physics for particles (e.g., gravity, wind) or more intricate musical patterns.

✋ Multi-touch Support: Enhance touch interactions for more complex drawing gestures.
